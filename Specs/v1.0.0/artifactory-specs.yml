ArtifactoryUpload:
    # Enable or disable artifactory upload functionality
    isArtifactoryUploadRequired: false
    
    isReturnBuildInfo: true

    # [Mandatory]    
    # Target server to upload artifact valid valus are "artifactory-dev" and "artifactoryprod"
    server: "artifactoryprod"

     # [Mandatory]
    # Specifies the target path in Artifactory in the following format: [repository_name]/[repository_path]
    # If the pattern ends with a slash, for example "repo-name/a/b/", 
    # then "b" is assumed to be a folder in Artifactory and the files are uploaded into it. 
    # In the case of "repo-name/a/b", the uploaded file is renamed to "b" in Artifactory.    
    # For flexibility in specifying the upload path, you can include placeholders in the form of {1}, {2}, {3}...
    # which are replaced by corresponding tokens in the source path that are enclosed in parenthesis, For more details, please refer to Using Placeholders.
    target: "\"devops-pypi-dev-local/Prod/Python-Calc/\""


    # [Mandatory]
    # Specifies the local file system path to artifacts which should be uploaded to Artifactory. 
    # You can specify multiple artifacts by using wildcards or a regular expression as designated by the regexp property.
    # If you use a regexp, you need to escape any reserved characters (such as ".", "?", etc.) 
    # used in the expression using a backslash "\". 
    pattern: "\"./dist/*.*\""

    # [Optional] 
    # List of "key=value" pairs separated by a semi-colon ( ; ) to be attached as properties to the uploaded properties. 
    # If any key can take several values, then each value is separated by a comma ( , ). For example, "key1=value1;key2=value21,value22;key3=value3".
